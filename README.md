# Do Not:
- Cut/remove the power cord third prong
- Use the adapter plug
- Use a frayed/word or damaged power cord
- Plug in the refrigerator via an extension cord
- Use the power cord near heated surfaces.
- To prevent child entrapment and suffocation: - remove the doors from the old refrigerator - leave the racks in place to discourage entry - cut off the plug's prongs, then remove and discard the power cord separate from the refrigerator. 
- Do not store or use combustible/explosive vapors or liquids (e.g., alcohol, paint thinner) inside or near the refrigerator. 
- Do not install the refrigerator near a gas stove, water heater, or other possible ignition source of leaking gas. 
- Turn the refrigerator OFF for long periods of non-use or during a severe electrical storm. 
- A leaky refrigerator is an electric-shock/fire hazard; have it serviced by an authorized technician before using it. 
- Do not spray water in/on the refrigerator; do not clean it with toxic chemicals or abrasive substances. 
- The insulation around electrical parts decays over time and may cause electric shock or fire. (Smoke or a burning-wire smell from the refrigerator signals a possible fire hazard; turn the appliance off immediately, and contact the service center. 
- Letting anyone other than an authorized technician work on the refrigerator may cause a fire and likely void the warranty. 
- Do not store non-edible items in the refrigerator; use it only in the home. (Outside/non-standard use risks fire/electric shock, deterioration of stored items, and a chemical reaction between refrigerator components and stored items.)
